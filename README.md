# Code Quiz Application

- **Hilt**: For dependency injection.
- **Jetpack Compose Navigation**: For navigation between screens.
- **Firebase**:
  - **Firebase Database**: For real-time data.
  - **Firebase Firestore**: For storing quiz data and user information.

## The application building is in progress.
Every day I am making few changes in the code. So far I have done quite good job, but still its is large amount of work ahead me.
